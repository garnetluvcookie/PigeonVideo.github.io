# Security Tips
Here are some tips on how to keep your account secure!
If you have many followers, especially if you're popular,
some hackers might try to take over your account!
These are the best ways to stay safe and secure.

**Make a strong password**<br>
Now you may think, this is so obvious!
Well, let's just take a look at some pretty bad password examples.

Your birth date would be a bad password, for example "210410".
You could easily just tell your birthday to someone online, and they could take over your account!

A word and some numbers; you could argue that it's a good combination, but you're wrong!
Like, "Motorcycle23" is a bad example; it's 12 characters long, but not safe enough

Those were bad password examples, but how to make a good password?<br>
Use. Random. Characters!!!
A good example of a password is "zxczxc6o8"<br>
It has unguessable characters, you can't just hack that easily!
